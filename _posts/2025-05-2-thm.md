### Pacu

Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework created and maintained by Rhino Security Labs to assist in offensive security testing against cloud environments. Pacu allows penetration testers to exploit configuration flaws within an AWS environment using an extensible collection of modules with a diverse feature-set. Current modules enable a range of attacks, including user privilege escalation, backdooring of IAM users, attacking vulnerable Lambda functions, and much more.

`whoami` will list information related to the AWS keys currently set as the default. This can include information such as what their username is, what keys are being used, what permissions the user has, and more.
